# SVGs - Scalable Vector Graphics

SVGs are a scalable image format, They can easily scale to any size and retain their quality without increasing their file size.
They can also be useful if you need to create or modify their images programmatically, because you can change their properties through CSS and JS.

SVGs are images defined by math, as opposed to traditional "raster graphics", where your image is defined by a grid of pixels.

SVGs are defined using XML, aka Extensible Markup Language.

SVGs are often used for icons, graphs.charts, large simple images, patterned backgrounds and applying effects to other elements via SVG filters.

## Drawbacks

SVGs are great for relatively simple images, but because every single detail of the image needs to be written out as XML, they are extremely inefficient at storing complex images.
