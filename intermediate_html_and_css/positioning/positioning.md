# Positioning

## Static and relative positioning

The default positioning mode that you have gotten used to is `position: static`. The difference between static and relative is fairly simple. Static is the default position of every element, and properties `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` do not affect the position of the element. Relative on the other hand is pretty much the same as static, but properties `top`, `right...(etc)` displace the element relative to its normal position in the flow of the document.

## Absolute positioning

`position: absolute` allows you to position something at an exact point in the screen without disturbing the other elements around it. More specifically, using absolute positioning on an element will remove that element from the normal document flow while being positioned relative to an ancestor. To put it in other words: elements that are removed from the normal flow of the document donâ€™t affect other elements and are also not affected by other elements. Using absolute positioning allows you to position elements anywhere on the screen using top, right, bottom, and left properties. This property is really useful when you want to position something at an exact point on the screen, without disturbing any of the other elements. A couple of good use cases for absolute positioning are:

- modals
- image with a caption
- icons on top of other elements

**Disclaimer**: absolute positioning has very specific use cases and if possible, using flexbox or grid should be prioritised. It shouldn't be used to do entire page layouts.

## Fixed position

Fixed elements are also removed from the normal flow of the document and are positioned relative to the `viewport`. You basically use `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties to position it, and it will stay there as the user scrolls. This is especially useful for things like navigation bars and floating chat buttons.


## Sticky positioning 

Sticky elements will act like normal elements until you scroll past them, and then they start behaving like fixed elements. They are also not taken out of the normal flow of the document.
