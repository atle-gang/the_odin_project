## Block vs Inline

Most of the elements that you have learned about so far as block elements. In other words, their default style is `display: block`. By default, block elements will appear on the page stacked atop each other, each new element starting on a new line.

Inline elements, however do not start on a new line. They appear in line with whatever elements they are placed beside. A clear example of an inline element is a link, or `<a>` tag.

### The middle ground inline-block

Inline-block elements behave like inline elements, but with block-style padding and margin. `display: inline-block` is a useful tool to know about, but in practice, you’ll probably end up reaching for flexbox more often if you’re trying to line up a bunch of boxes.
