# Elements and Tags

Opening tags tell the browser this is the start of an HTML element. They are compromised of a keyword enclosed in angle brackets `<>`. For example, an opening paragraph tag looks like this: `<p>`.

Closing tags tell the browser where an element ends. They are almost the same as opening tags; the only difference is that they have a forward slash before the keyword. For example, a closing tag looks like this: `</p>`

A full paragraph element looks like this:

```html

<p>Some text content</p>

```


There are some HTML elements that do not have a closing tag. These elements often look like this: `<br />` or `<img/>` but some can also bbe used without the closing forward slash such as `<br>` or `<img>`. These are known as self-closing tags or empty elements because they do not wraap any content.
