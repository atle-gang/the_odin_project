    <!-- Flex Grow -->

    <!-- 'flex-grow' expects a single number as its value, and that number to be used as a flex-items 
    'growth factor' -->
    <div class="flex-container">

    <!-- Flex-shrink is similar to 'flex-grow' but sets the 'shrink factor' of a flex item.
    'flex-shrink' only ends up being applied if the size of all flex items are larger than their parent container -->

    <!-- For example, if our 3 divs from above had a width declaration like: width: 100px, and 'flex-direction' was smaller than 300px,
    our divs would have to shrink to fit -->

    <!-- The default shrink factor is 1. If you do not want an item to shrink then you can specify 'flex-shrink: 0;'-->
